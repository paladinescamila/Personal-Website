## How to run

1. This project was built with React.js, so to run it you need to have npm installed.
2. Once you have downloaded the project and are in the main folder, run the following command:

    ```sh
    npm install

    ```

3. Then, run the project with

    This will open your browser at http://localhost:3000, where you can see the graphical interface.
